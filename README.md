# Random Password Generator (Third-Challenge)

Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a random password generator using the skills I have learned in Java script. It can be used for users that have a hard time creating safe passwords for their accounts, with this password generator they can easily create a safe password selecting how long they want it to be, if they want it to have numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and/or special characters. With this generator the problem can be solved in less than a minute. Through this coding process I learne more about arrays and functions.
